Looking at the detective's desk you can see the following items to examine; a [photograph], a [file] and a [coffee mug].

[photograph]:
Looks like some kind of work celebration. The detective is in the middle of the picture holding a basket of fruit and other officers are toasting him.

[file]:
The file is empty. You notice though that the tab has your brother's name on it!

[coffee mug]:
It is just a coffee mug.

You have examined every item.
