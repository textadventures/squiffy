title: Rotate and Sequence

For a text link that replaces itself each time it is clicked:

{% include sample.html file="rotate" %}

You can store the result in an attribute:

{% include sample.html file="rotate2" %}

If you don't want a rotating list, use a sequence instead. The final option won't be a link.

{% include sample.html file="sequence" %}    

As a variation on this, you can use a section link as the final option in a sequence.

{% include sample.html file="sequence2" %}
