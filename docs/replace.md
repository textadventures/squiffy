title: Replacing text
---

By creating labels, you can replace existing output when a link is clicked or when a passage or section is displayed. In the example below, we create a label called "1", and we change the text in that label using a link:

{% include sample.html file="replace" %}

We can also change the text when a section or passage is displayed:

{% include sample.html file="replace2" %}

If the replacement text matches a section or passage name, the contents of that section or passage will be inserted instead.

{% include sample.html file="replace3" %}
