Choose a number: {rotate:one:two:three}

+++OK...

Now {rotate result:four:five:six}

+++OK...

You chose {result}.

Now for a sequence: {sequence:one:two:three:four:five}.

+++And another...

Another sequence: {sequence seqresult:a:b:c:d:e:f:g}.

+++Finally...

You chose {seqresult}.

Here's a sequence that links to another section. {sequence:Ready...:Steady...:[[Go!]]}

[[Go!]]:

That's all folks!
