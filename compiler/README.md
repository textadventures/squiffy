Squiffy
=======

Squiffy is a tool for creating multiple choice interactive fiction. Squiffy is written entirely in JavaScript - the compiler uses [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the games it generates run in a web browser.

For installation and usage instructions, [see the documentation](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/squiffy/).

The plans for forthcoming releases are on the [development roadmap](http://docs.textadventures.co.uk/squiffy/roadmap.html).

For discussion and help, see [the forums](http://forum.textadventures.co.uk/viewforum.php?f=24).

You can run your local copy of Squiffy instead of the globally-installed version from npm by using `node squiffy.js` in place of the `squiffy` command. If you're using Windows and want to replace the global `squiffy` command with your local development version:

1. Clone master of your fork to your local machine (e.g., `C:\projects\squiffy\`). 
2. Install Nodejs if you haven't already
3. From your squiffy directory, run `npm install`
4. Next run `npm install squiffy -g`
5. Delete the new `squiffy` folder in your global `node_modules` folder: `C:\Users\[yourUser]\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\squiffy`
4. Open a new command prompt as Administrator.
5. Create a symlink between your npm and development squiffy folders by running `mklink /D C:\Users\[yourUser]\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\squiffy C:\projects\squiffy`

Now running `squiffy helloworld.squiffy` will use the code from your project folder.
