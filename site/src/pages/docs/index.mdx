Squiffy is a tool for creating interactive fiction - that is, multiple choice games that focus on text and story. Players navigate through the game or story by clicking links. Sometimes these kinds of games or stories are known as [gamebooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook).

Squiffy is free and open source. It creates HTML and JavaScript, so you can upload it to your own website, or to a site like [itch.io](https://itch.io/) or [textadventures.co.uk](https://textadventures.co.uk).

A player's state is automatically saved to their browser's local storage, so they can always pick up from where they left off just by going back to the same web page.

Using Squiffy
-------------

You can find Squiffy at [app.squiffystory.com](https://app.squiffystory.com/).

Example
-------

<Sample script="Squiffy is a tool for creating interactive stories.

You write your story in a text file. Each choice is represented by a [[new section]]. You can create links to new sections by surrounding them in double square brackets.

[[new section]]:

In addition to sections, Squiffy has the concept of passages. These are sections of text that don't advance the story. For example, you can click this [passage link], and this [other passage link], but the story won't advance until you click this [[section link]].

[passage link]:

This is the text for the first passage link.

[other passage link]:

This is the text for the second passage link.

[[section link]]:

When a new section appears, any unclicked passage links from the previous section are disabled."></Sample>

Publishing your game
--------------------

Squiffy creates HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, which you can upload anywhere. You don't need to distribute your source `.squiffy` file - everything that is needed for the game to run is contained in the HTML and JavaScript.

If you're using the web version, just hit the Publish button to share your game on textadventures.co.uk. You can also choose "Export HTML and JavaScript" from the Download menu, which will give you a ZIP file you can upload to any website.

If you're using the app for Windows, MacOS or Linux, hit the Build button to create the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files in the same directory as the game file. This will also open the results in your web browser for you to preview.
