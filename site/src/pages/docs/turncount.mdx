You can trigger a passage after the player has made a certain number of clicks within a section. For example, you can display some extra text, to indicate the passage of time. Or, the passage might run some JavaScript to automatically move the player to another section.

In the example below, the text "We're nearly here. The train is pulling into the platform." is always written after the first passage click. After the second passage click, we are moved into the next section.

<Sample script="On the train you can see a [girl singing], a [man reading a book] and an [old woman].

[girl singing]:
She is nodding her head to the music in her enormous earphones, and singing badly out of tune.

[man reading a book]:
He's been reading the same page of *War and Peace* for a while now.

[old woman]:
She eyes you suspiciously, as if she has seen your type before.

[@1]:
We're nearly here. The train is pulling into the platform.

[@2]:
&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;squiffy.story.go(&quot;station&quot;);

[[station]]:
We have now arrived at the station."></Sample>

You can also trigger a passage to be written only after all the passages in that section have been clicked on.

See the example below where after all passage links have been clicked the text "You have examined every item." will display.

<Sample script="Looking at the detective's desk you can see the following items to examine; a [photograph], a [file] and a [coffee mug].

[photograph]:
Looks like some kind of work celebration. The detective is in the middle of the picture holding a basket of fruit and other officers are toasting him.

[file]:
The file is empty. You notice though that the tab has your brother's name on it!

[coffee mug]:
It is just a coffee mug.

[@last]:
You have examined every item."></Sample>
