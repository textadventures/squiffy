By creating labels, you can replace existing output when a link is clicked or when a passage or section is displayed. In the example below, we create a label called "1", and we change the text in that label using a link:

<Sample script="I walked to the shops and I bought {label:1=a pint of milk}.

    Or maybe [I bought something different?](@replace 1=a loaf of bread)"></Sample>

We can also change the text when a section or passage is displayed:

<Sample script="I walked to the shops and I bought {label:1=a pint of milk}.

    Or maybe [I bought something different?](next passage)

    [next passage]:
    @replace 1=a bottle of whisky

    I changed my mind."></Sample>

If the replacement text matches a section or passage name, the contents of that section or passage will be inserted instead.

<Sample script="I walked to the shops and I {label:1=bought a pint of milk}.

    But I was [thinking](@replace 1=thoughts)...

    [thoughts]:
    suddenly thought, hang on, I could [[go to the funfair]] or [[join the circus]] instead.

    [[go to the funfair]]:
    Off I went to the funfair...

    [[join the circus]]:
    Off I went to the circus..."></Sample>
