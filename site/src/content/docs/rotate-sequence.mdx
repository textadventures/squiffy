For a text link that replaces itself each time it is clicked:

<Sample script="{rotate:one:two:three}"></Sample>

You can store the result in an attribute:

<Sample script="Please choose: {rotate size:small:medium:large}

    +++Then continue...

    You chose {size}."></Sample>

If you don't want a rotating list, use a sequence instead. The final option won't be a link.

<Sample script="{sequence:Ready:Steady:Go}"></Sample>

As a variation on this, you can use a section link as the final option in a sequence.

<Sample script="{sequence:Click me:Click me again:[[And once more]](next)}

    [[next]]:
    Done!"></Sample>
