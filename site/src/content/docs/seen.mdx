import Sample from "@components/Sample.astro"

You can tell if the player has seen a passage or section using JavaScript:

```
    if (squiffy.story.seen("passage3")) alert ("You have seen passage3!");
```

You can also conditionally display text:

<Sample script="You can see a [cupboard]. Maybe you should [open] it?

[open]:
You open the cupboard.

[cupboard]:
The cupboard is {if seen open:open, and there are empty bottles inside}{else:closed}."></Sample>
