Squiffy is a tool for creating interactive fiction - that is,
multiple choice games that focus on text and story. Players
navigate through the game or story by clicking links.

Squiffy is free and open source. It creates HTML and JavaScript,
so you can upload it to your own website, or to a site like
<a href="https://textadventures.co.uk">textadventures.co.uk</a>
or <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a>.

A player's state is automatically saved to their browser's local
storage, so they can always pick up from where they left off
just by going back to the same web page.

The Squiffy Editor runs entirely in your browser.
All your data is saved locally on your device, automatically.

Using Squiffy
-------------

You can find Squiffy at [app.squiffystory.com](https://app.squiffystory.com/).

Example
-------

This documentation features _editable examples_. Edit the example on the left,
and play it on the right.

<Sample script="Squiffy is a tool for creating interactive stories.

    You write your story in a text file. Each choice is represented by a [[new section]]. You can create links to new sections by surrounding them in double square brackets.

    [[new section]]:

    In addition to sections, Squiffy has the concept of passages. These are sections of text that don't advance the story. For example, you can click this [passage link], and this [other passage link], but the story won't advance until you click this [[section link]].

    [passage link]:

    This is the text for the first passage link.

    [other passage link]:

    This is the text for the second passage link.

    [[section link]]:

    When a new section appears, any unclicked passage links from the previous section are disabled."></Sample>

Publishing your game
--------------------

Squiffy creates HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, which you can upload anywhere. You don't need to distribute your source `.squiffy` file - everything that is needed for the game to run is contained in the HTML and JavaScript.

The editor's Download menu offers several export options:

- **Export HTML and JavaScript** - Creates a ZIP file containing `index.html`, `style.css`, `story.js`, and `squiffy.runtime.global.js`. Upload these files to any web server.

- **Export HTML (single file)** - Creates a single self-contained HTML file with all CSS and JavaScript embedded. This is ideal for easy sharing, uploading to platforms that only accept one file, or offline distribution.

- **Export JavaScript only** - Creates just the `story.js` file, useful if you want to integrate your story into a custom HTML page.

- **Download Squiffy script** - Downloads your source `.squiffy` file for backup or editing elsewhere.

You can also use the [command-line tool](/cli/) for more control over the build process.
