## Why Squiffy?

    Squiffy generates pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Upload to your own website, itch.io, textadventures.co.uk, or anywhere that hosts static files.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Works Offline" icon="laptop">
    The editor runs entirely in your browser with no account required. Your work is automatically saved to your device.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Free and Open Source" icon="open-book">
    Squiffy is completely free to use. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license.
