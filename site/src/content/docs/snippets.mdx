Snippets let you insert commonly-used patterns into your story with a single click. The editor provides two kinds: **built-in snippets** for frequent Squiffy and Handlebars patterns, and **user-defined snippets** you declare in your `.squiffy` file for patterns specific to your game.

## Built-in snippets

The **Snippets** dropdown button in the editor toolbar contains a set of ready-made templates for the most common patterns.

| Snippet | Inserts |
|---|---|
| If block | `{{#if condition}}…{{/if}}` |
| If/else block | `{{#if condition}}…{{else}}…{{/if}}` |
| If (check variable) | `{{#if (eq (get "variable") "value")}}…{{/if}}` |
| If (seen section) | `{{#if (seen "section")}}…{{/if}}` |
| Set variable | `{{set "variable" "value"}}` |
| Increment | `{{inc "variable"}}` |
| Decrement | `{{dec "variable"}}` |
| Section link | `{{section "name" text="label"}}` |
| Passage link | `{{passage "name" text="label"}}` |
| Embed | `{{embed "name"}}` |

Click a snippet to insert it at the current cursor position, then edit the placeholder values as needed.

## User-defined snippets

For patterns you use repeatedly in a particular game, you can define your own snippets directly in your `.squiffy` file using the `[snippet: name]:` syntax:

```
[snippet: Heal player]:
{{inc "health"}}

[snippet: Quest complete]:
{{set "quest_done" true}}{{inc "score"}}
[[Quest completed]](questbook)
```

User-defined snippets appear under **My snippets** in the Snippets dropdown, below the built-in snippets.

<Aside>
Snippet blocks are stripped out by the compiler and never appear in the compiled output. They exist only in the editor as reusable text templates — you insert them, then edit the content in place.

### Placement

Snippet blocks can appear anywhere in your file — before, between, or after sections. They don't belong to any section or passage, and their content is ignored by the compiler.

```
[[intro]]:
You wake up in a forest.

Your health is {{health}}.

[snippet: Heal player]:
{{inc "health"}}

[snippet: Take damage]:
{{dec "health"}}

[[clearing]]:
You find a clearing.
```

### Example: health system

Here's an example with two user-defined snippets — `Heal player` and `Take damage` — alongside the sections that use them. The snippet definitions are stripped by the compiler; the `{{inc}}` and `{{dec}}` calls inside each passage are what was inserted from those snippets:

<Sample script="[snippet: Heal player]:
{{inc &quot;health&quot; 2}}

[snippet: Take damage]:
{{dec &quot;health&quot; 3}}

[[forest]]:
@set health = 10
@set max_health = 10

You are in the forest. Health: {{health}}/{{max_health}}

Do you [rest by the stream] or [venture deeper]?

[rest by the stream]:
{{inc &quot;health&quot; 2}}

You rest and recover. Health: {{health}}/{{max_health}}

[venture deeper]:
{{dec &quot;health&quot; 3}}

A wolf attacks! Health: {{health}}/{{max_health}}

{{#if (lte health 0)}}
You have been defeated.
{{else}}
You survive, but you're wounded.
{{/if}}"></Sample>
