*Importing files only works in the command-line version of Squiffy*

You can split your script up into multiple files and import them:

```
@import other_file.squiffy
```

You can also use the same syntax to import external JavaScript files:

```
@import my_script.js
```

This syntax also accepts wildcards, so you can include all .squiffy files in a directory:

```
@import *.squiffy
```
