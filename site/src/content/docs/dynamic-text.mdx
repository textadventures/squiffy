## Replace text

By creating labels, you can replace existing output when a link is clicked or when a passage or section is displayed. In the example below, we create a label called "1", and we change the text in that label using a link:

<Sample script="I walked to the shops and I bought {{#label &quot;1&quot;}}a pint of milk{{/label}}.

    Or maybe [I bought something different?](@replace 1=a loaf of bread)"></Sample>

We can also change the text when a section or passage is displayed:

<Sample script="I walked to the shops and I bought {{#label &quot;1&quot;}}a pint of milk{{/label}}.

    Or maybe [I bought something different?](next passage)

    [next passage]:
    @replace 1=a bottle of whisky

    I changed my mind."></Sample>

If the replacement text matches a section or passage name, the contents of that section or passage will be inserted instead.

<Sample script="I walked to the shops and I {{#label &quot;1&quot;}}a pint of milk{{/label}}.

    But I was [thinking](@replace 1=thoughts)...

    [thoughts]:
    suddenly thought, hang on, I could [[go to the funfair]] or [[join the circus]] instead.

    [[go to the funfair]]:
    Off I went to the funfair...

    [[join the circus]]:
    Off I went to the circus..."></Sample>

## Rotate

For a text link that replaces itself each time it is clicked:

<Sample script="{{rotate (array &quot;one&quot; &quot;two&quot; &quot;three&quot;)}}"></Sample>

You can store the result in an attribute:

<Sample script="Please choose: {{rotate (array &quot;small&quot; &quot;medium&quot; &quot;large&quot;) set=&quot;size&quot;}}

        +++Then continue...

        You chose {{get &quot;size&quot;}}."></Sample>

## Sequence

If you don't want a rotating list, use a sequence instead. The final option won't be a link.

<Sample script="{{sequence (array &quot;Ready&quot; &quot;Steady&quot; &quot;Go&quot;)}}"></Sample>

As a variation on this, you can use a section link as the final option in a sequence.

<Sample script="{{sequence (array &quot;Click me&quot; &quot;Click me again&quot; (section &quot;next&quot; text=&quot;And once more&quot;))}}

        [[next]]:
        Done!"></Sample>
