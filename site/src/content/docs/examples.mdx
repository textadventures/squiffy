Here are some complete example stories that demonstrate Squiffy's capabilities.

## Coffee Shop Story

A narrative-driven story about your first two days working at a coffee shop called "The Daily Grind". This example demonstrates:

- Text input for player customization
- Variable tracking with `@set` and `@inc`
- Conditional text based on player choices
- Relationship tracking with multiple characters
- Multiple story endings

<Sample script={coffeeshop} alwaysShowRestart={true} />

## Game Show

"The Wheel of Dubious Fortune" - an interactive game show hosted by the chaotic Hank. This example demonstrates:

- Animations (`{{#animate "typewriter"}}` and `{{#animate "toast"}}`)
- Live updates (`{{live "score"}}`)
- Randomization (`{{random}}`)
- Complex state tracking (score, rounds, patience)
- Nested conditional logic
- Dynamic scoring system
